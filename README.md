# react-props
Assignment that demonstrates knowledge of React and how to use states. I created cards that rotate on hover and buttons that change on clikc. This assignment was really fun and I'm very much enjoying React. Contrary to my other React assignments, I actually managed to upload this one onto GitHub with no issues.
